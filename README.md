# Bank_Personal_Loan_Modelling_using-Classification-Algorithms
In this project, we learn about Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), which are powerful machine learning models used for classification tasks. It also includes training and interpreting models using these algorithms with a real-world banking dataset.

# Decision Trees 
It is a type of supervised learning algorithm that is mostly used for classification problems. It splits the data into subsets based on the value of input features, creating a tree-like model of decisions.

# Random Forests 
It is an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the mode of the classes for classification. They improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting.

# Support Vector Machines (SVM) 
This is a  supervised learning model that analyzes data for classification and regression analysis. SVMs are effective in high-dimensional spaces and are versatile due to different kernel functions for the decision function.
